                        <p>Your experience: I had an amazing experience with Dr. Cantu. I had a breast lift which included having a slight reduction in my breast. In addition, I have a genetic blood disorder that would make this and any other surgical procedure challenging. Dr. Cantu took every single precaution to ensure I was able to undergo any procedure. He referred me to another amazing physician who provide an approval clearance for me to continue with the procedure. The surgery was a big success and he took his time the entire procedure. He is such a perfectionist! His stands 100% behind his work. Dr. Cantu was recommended to me from other expats in the Los Cabos area. Highly recommend Dr. Cantu - he is incredibility talented.</p>

                        <p>I am a 67 year old female and had my surgery on February 7th 2019 in San Jose del Cabo Mexico. Dr. Cantu was my surgeon and he performed a lower facelift and an eyelift. Prior to the surgery as per Dr Cantu instructions I had blood work, chest x-ray and EKG done prior to surgery. The surgery went as planned and my recovery was smooth and I was able to go home that evening which I was really happy to do. I saw Dr Cantu the very next morning so he could take my bandages off and see how everything was progressing and he told me what I was to expect during my recovery phase.</p>
                        <p>As a registered nurse I really appreciated Dr Cantu's attention to detail and was very pleased to be able to see Dr Cantu on a weekly basis after my surgery for him to see the progress answer all and any questions and remove stitches as they became ready. </p>
                        <p>He has an amazing bedside manner. Overall I had quite a wonderful experience I had absolutely no pain, there was some discomfort with the swelling and the bruising but nothing analgesics couldn't handle. Aside from his skill as a surgeon I most appreciated his honesty and integrity, he never promised anything he couldn't deliver and was able to explain and reassure me at every turn that everything would be fine and as it turned out he was absolutely right. I am very happy with my results and would recommend Dr Cantu very highly.</p>

                        <p>I did have very complicated surgery removing excess skin on my legs and arms and was super impressed with my surgeon who is Dr.  Hector Cantu.  He will answer your emails or phone calls really quickly.  I would recommend him highly.   He is also very good about your aftercare and keeps in touch with you until you are all healed. He will be very honest on what the results would be.  He will need to know what medications you've been on and do a survey of your medical history too to see if you are a good candidate.</p>

                        <p>I was thinking of having a facelift done in Mexico and a friend recommended Dr. Cantu to me.   So a friend and I went for a consultation with him.  He explained what a face-lift would entail, the cost to him and the hospital, and gave information about the two hospitals in our area.  We decided to go forward with our face-lifts and made another appointment to see Dr. Cantu. From the beginning Dr. Cantu gave me the facts about having a face-lift.  He reassured me that there would be no pain, just swelling and bruising.  He walked me through the steps of recovery and made me feel comfortable about my decision.</p>
                        <p>Dr.Cantu paid close attention to what I was looking for and created breasts which closely resemble the shape and size of my original breasts. I am finally able to move on after my mastectomy many years ago.</p>
                        <p>I chose to have my surgery at BlueNet Hospital and found the staff to be caring and extremely attentive and Dr.Cantu was obviously respected by everyone I came across. </p>
                        <p>I healed beautifully and highly recommend Dr.Cantu as he is a gifted surgeon. ‘’</p>

                            It was very important to me to write of my surgery with Dr. Cantu. My experience from beginning to end, was without question, the most outstanding surgical experience I have ever had. Over my life, I have had at least seven surgeries in California. I have always had complications. I did not ever want to have another surgery. <br>
                            However, I began to have notable pain in my 20 year old breast implants and unhappily consulted my doctors at Healthy Cabo. They confidently referred me to Dr Cantu. My implants had significant capsular contraction and needed to be removed. Dr Cantu very thoughtfully explained my options and helped me be very clear of what I could expect. <br>
                            He inspired trust, was very caring and took time for every single question that I had. He and his wonderful nurse, Erika work smoothly together and organized everything for my surgery the following week. <br>
                            As one example of the level of care ...I told him that I had a lot of difficulties with IVs being started and he made sure that the pediatric phlebotomist was there to start my IV. His team in the OR was also outstanding as was everyone I had contact with at Blue Net. I stayed over night, and was well looked after. I had no complications (even with drains). Simply put, I had a textbook recovery with little to no pain. Dr. Cantu is an extremely gifted surgeon, a really lovely human being and I can recommend him wholeheartedly.
